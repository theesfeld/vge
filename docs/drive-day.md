# Drive day — one command

## Command

```sh
cd ~/Projects/mfd
./cmfd.sh
```

This does a **release build**, then starts the live CMFD glass with Bluetooth OBD and a **comprehensive capture** under `captures/drive-TIMESTAMP/`.

Quit with **Esc**. Capture files finalize on exit.

## What you get on disk

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `frames.ndjson` | Every TX/RX hex frame (Mode 01, Mode 09, DTC, UDS) |
| `signals.csv` | Decoded name/value/unit time series |
| `meta.toml` | Session meta (VIN, adapter, times) |
| `session.json` | Session summary + frame count |
| `cmfd-run.txt` | Shell pointer for this run |

After the drive, parse that directory (or hand it to the agent).

## Modes

| Command | Role |
|---------|------|
| `./cmfd.sh` or `./cmfd.sh drive` | Glass + capture (commute default) |
| `./cmfd.sh capture` | Headless crush (DID range scan + long poll) |
| `./cmfd.sh glass` | Glass only, no capture files |
| `./cmfd.sh build` | Release bins only |

Headless long capture example:

```sh
./cmfd.sh capture --seconds 7200
```

## Adapter note

One ELM Bluetooth SPP client at a time. Drive mode runs **capture inside `mfd-demo`** (`MFD_OBD_CAPTURE` + `MFD_OBD_CRUSH`). Do not start a second `mfd-obd-capture` process against the same adapter while the glass is live.

## Env (defaults for this truck)

| Variable | Default |
|----------|---------|
| `MFD_OBD_BT` | `00:04:3E:96:B8:F1` |
| `MFD_OBD_BT_CHANNEL` | `1` |
| `MFD_OBD_CRUSH` | `1` (drive mode) |
| `MFD_HZ` | `30` |
| `MFD_CAMERA` | optional `/dev/videoN` or `auto` |
| `MFD_SKIP_BUILD=1` | skip cargo when bins are already built |

## Crush coverage

**Drive (glass) process**

1. Capability probe (BIT)
2. Mode 09 VIN + extras
3. Mode 03 / 07 / 0A DTCs
4. Mode 01 PID support discover + continuous poll
5. Multi-module UDS known DIDs (PCM, BCM, ABS, IPC, PSCM)
6. Ford catalog DIDs on continuous rotation
7. All frames → capture dir (flushed often)

**Headless `./cmfd.sh capture`**

Same as above, plus DID **range scans** (`F400–F4FF`, `1E00–1EFF`, `2B00–2B7F` on select modules). That scan is slow; use when you can leave the truck parked at start.

## Display-only

Never clear DTCs, write DIDs, or security unlock.

## Pages for dense data

| Page | Layout intent |
|------|---------------|
| ENG | Large RPM gauge + ENG channel numerics |
| FUEL | Big % + FP + fuel tape + matrix |
| FLUD | Four temp gauges (OIL/ECT/TFT/IAT) + matrix |
| ELEC | Battery gauge + load tape |
| DRV | Speed gauge + gear + RPM tape + matrix |
| BUS | Full channel dump (2–3 columns) |
| DTC | Fault list (read-only) |

## After work

```sh
ls -la captures/drive-*/
# agent: parse frames.ndjson + signals.csv
```
